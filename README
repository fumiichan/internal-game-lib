nwjs game lib
=============

internal tool

USAGE
=====

Download recent nw.js application at the https://nwjs.io
You may download SDK or Normal version. LTS is recommended for better compatibility
on older rmmv/rmmz games

Extract the nw.js archive to the root folder of the project. Ensure that the
package.json and nw.exe and other files that came along with nwjs archive are on same folder.

To add your games, create a new folder on the Applications folder. Ensure that you create these
folders:


- Applications
|---- + <your game name>
      |---- save           -------------> your save data
      |---- translations   -------------> contains translation cache generated by the hook
      |---- www            -------------> contains your game data


NOTE: www folder should contain whats inside your www folder in your rmmv game. Otherwise if
your game doesn't have www folder (in the case of rmmz games) you can copy entire game files
into the www folder.

ABOUT TRANSLATION
=================

translation services will be available soon.

To use translation, you need a translatior API keys which is available on Microsoft Azure.
